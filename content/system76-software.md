## Disclaimer

Except in some rare cases, System76 QA and Engineering teams do not test other OSes on our hardware. This section is provided for informational purposes only.System76 encourages users to take ownership of their machines and install whatever software or operating systems they prefer.

However, System76 does not guarantee the success or quality of experience when installing other Operating Systems.
Support typically makes best-efforts to offer direction or troubleshooting for other distributions.

We may determine that troubleshooting has exceeded the scope of support. If that's the case, further questions should be referred to those Operating System(s)' support forums.

**NOTE:** These instructions were tested on a Galago Pro (galp3-b) and Pangolin (pang10). Neither system have NVIDIA GPUs, so this process doesn't go over installing the NVIDIA driver (system76-driver-nvidia). Due to these limitations, switchable graphics may not work on NVIDIA systems.
